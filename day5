🚀 Day 05 – Debugging Lists & Dictionaries in Python
Python Debugging Lab (14-Day Series)

Today I focused on debugging one of the most common real-world problem areas:

👉 Lists and Dictionaries

Many hidden bugs in data pipelines and backend systems happen due to incorrect list manipulation or unsafe dictionary access.

🔍 Topics Covered

Modifying a list while iterating

Index shifting issues

Safe list filtering

Dictionary KeyError

Safe dictionary access using .get()

Shallow copy behavior

💡 Key Learning #1 – Modifying List While Looping
nums = [1,2,3,4]

for n in nums:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        nums.remove(n)

print(nums)

This may produce unexpected behavior because removing elements shifts the list while iterating.

Safer approach:

nums = [n for n in nums if n % 2 != 0]

Never modify a list while iterating over it directly.

💡 Key Learning #2 – Dictionary KeyError
d = {"x": 10}
print(d["y"])

This crashes with:

KeyError

Safer approach:

print(d.get("y", 0))

.get() prevents crashes and allows default values.

💡 Key Learning #3 – Shallow Copy Trap
a = [[1,2],[3,4]]
b = a.copy()

b[0][0] = 99
print(a)

Output:

[[99, 2], [3, 4]]

Even after copying, inner lists remain shared.

This is called shallow copy behavior.

Understanding this is critical when working with nested data structures.
